# microwave_oven_simulation
Created a Microwave Oven Simulation Project using the MPLab x IDE Software and used the PICSimLab Software to demonstrate the simulation of the project.

Coding software used: MPLab x IDE 
Compiler Used: XC8 compiler
Simulation Software: PICSimLab
Microcontroller used: PIC16f877a

The project gave a strong insight into C programming basics and its usage in Embedded Systems. Also gained knowledge about the architecture of the PIC microcontrollers. Extensively involved complex programming and file Handling. ISR Handling (Interrupt Service Routines) was also covered.
